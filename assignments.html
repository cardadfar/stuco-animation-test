        <p class='main-title'> 98-331: Student-Taught Course | Animation & Video Editing </p>
        <p class='body-text'>The course will consist of a Midterm, Final, and series of homeworks referred to as <span class='purple-text'>‘quick-edits’</span>. There will be a total of <span class='purple-text'>7 quick-edits</span> during the semester where students will have to render a short 10-20 second video utilizing concepts learned from the most recent lecture. Quick-edits are graded based on completion and are used to indicate whether a student understands how to correctly implement a certain effect or technique.</p>
        <p class='body-text'>The Midterm will be an extended quick-edit of about 30-45 seconds where students will create a video of their choice using video-editing, kinetic typography, and motion graphics. The Midterm demonstrates a student’s understanding in video-editing practices.</p>
        <p class='body-text'>The Final will be a video at least 1 minute long. Any video format is acceptable: animation, video-editing, live-action, motion graphics, etc. Students will document their process, from storyboarding, to animatics, to the final video.</p>
        <p class='body-text'> All assignments are due <u>Thursdays at 4:30pm</u> unless otherwise stated. Assignments are to be submitted to the StuCo AVE Google Drive folder. If you are enrolled and do not have access to this folder, please reach out to me.</p>
